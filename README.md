Hand Gesture Control System

Summary
The Hand Gesture Control System is an innovative project designed to enable intuitive interaction with devices through hand gestures. This system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize various hand gestures captured by a webcam, allowing users to perform commands without the need for traditional input devices.

Features 

Real-time Gesture Recognition: Utilizes a trained model to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time.
Device Control: Users can control applications (e.g., media players, presentations) using specific hand movements, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
Custom Gesture Mapping: Supports the creation of custom gestures mapped to specific functions, making the system adaptable to various user needs.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work on multiple operating systems, ensuring broad usability.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV for computer vision, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and NumPy for numerical operations.
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the gesture recognition model.
